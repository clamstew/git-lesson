1. Went to github repo for makersquare/git-lession
2. Forked repo into my account
3. cd'd into folder
4. git clone http://github.com/myuser/git-lesson
5. (git claim) - if on shared / or git config --global user.name "my name" // git config --global user.email emailaddress@com.come --> if on your own computer (only have to do once on your own computer)
6. from command line opened the file math.txt and edited the math
7. git add math.txt - this added it to the staging
8. git diff - showed us the actual changes in the text
9. git status - to see the changes had been added to stage
10. git commit -m "commit message" -- this put the staged file and committed it locally 
11. git log - to show the commits locally and globally from the cloned repo's history
12. git diff - showed us the actual changes in the text
13. subl list.txt - opened up the list of world populations
14. fixed the population error in that file
15. then committed that too with a new message
16. then ran $ git push origin master - which sends it up to github - origin tells to push where it was cloned from - master is the branch to push
17. went to github and the original repo - makersquare/git-lesson
    - then clicked on small green button to create pull request (says "Compare and review" on hover)
    - then on the next screen click compare across forks at the top 
    - that opens up the place to type the details for that pull request and has the title from your commit message
    - click the big green button call "Send pull request"
    - that pull is created for the original user
